Read file: .github/dependabot.yml

RIPER·Ω₁ Active [Session: Email-Service ArchiveContext]

Research findings for `.docs/archiveContext.md` and related infrastructure context:

1. Repository state (CI / workflows)
   • `.github` folder exists but only contains `dependabot.yml`.  
   • No GitHub Actions/other CI workflow files present (`.github/workflows/` directory is absent).  
   • Therefore, Step 9 (“CI pipeline update to fail build if RESEND\_\* env vars missing”) cannot yet reference an existing pipeline and will require creation from scratch.

2. Current code references to required variables
   • `astro.config.mjs` maps `RESEND_API_KEY`, `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`, `MAIL_DOMAIN` via `loadEnv()` → `process.env`.  
   • `src/lib/email.ts` instantiates `new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY)` and sets `from: process.env.RESEND_FROM_EMAIL || 'no-reply@example.com'`.  
   • Build will compile even if these are empty—no runtime guard yet.  
   • No tests or scripts currently assert presence of those variables.

3. Repository references & documentation
   • `.docs/archive/1.md` and `.docs/email.md` already document environment keys and call out the CI pre-deploy check.  
   • `.docs/archiveContext.md` captures high-level post-plan tasks (CI enforcement, domain verification, dev testing, staging, monitoring).  
   • There is a stub `src/pages/api/resend/webhook.ts` with a `// TODO: Implement proper webhook verification` comment.

4. External requirements (domain & compliance)
   • Resend requires SPF, DKIM, DMARC records on the sending domain; verification happens in Resend dashboard.  
   • Gmail/Yahoo 2024 bulk-sender rules enforce:  
    – authenticated domain (SPF or DKIM)  
    – DMARC policy  
    – one-click unsubscribe  
    – complaint rate < 0.1 %.  
   • Typical DNS values for Resend:  
    – SPF: `v=spf1 include:spf.resend.com ~all`  
    – DKIM: CNAMEs provided per-domain by Resend  
    – DMARC: `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain`

5. Complaint & bounce monitoring
   • Resend offers webhooks for `delivered`, `bounce`, `complaint`; webhook endpoint must verify signature (Svix HMAC).  
   • No monitoring/observability logic yet in repo.

6. Development-time safety
   • Plan stipulates Ethereal transport when `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`; current `email.ts` already references Ethereal in dev (confirmed in earlier code review).

7. Variable presence across deployment tooling
   • No `.env.example` yet containing Resend keys (Step 3 of plan calls for this).  
   • CI variable availability guard currently absent.

8. No existing test or script coverage
   • There are no unit/integration tests around email sending; mock/resend API not yet stubbed.

These points represent the factual state needed for any future updates to `archiveContext.md`.
