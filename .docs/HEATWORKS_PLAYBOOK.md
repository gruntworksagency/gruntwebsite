# Project Plan: 'Heatworks' - Local Visibility Audit MVP

## Executive Summary
**Problem:** Mid-sized landscaping and home service businesses lack a clear, quantifiable understanding of their true online visibility across their entire service area. They often lose valuable local jobs because they are invisible on Google Maps in key neighborhoods, but they don't have an easy way to diagnose this "visibility gap."

**Solution:** "Heatworks" is a fixed-fee ($149) diagnostic product that provides a comprehensive Local Visibility Audit. It delivers three core, hard-hitting components:
1.  An interactive **Heatmap Dashboard** showing the client's actual Google Maps ranking across their metro area.
2.  The **"Red Zone Revenue Leakage Report,"** a financial model that estimates the monthly revenue they are losing due to poor visibility in key service areas.
3.  The **"30-Day Momentum Plan,"** an actionable guide for immediate, high-impact fixes the client can perform themselves, which sets the stage for our core service upsell.

**Target Market:** The "Empowered Landscaper" and other home service business owners with annual revenues exceeding $500,000. These are established operators looking for a competitive edge and scalable growth, who are often skeptical of generic marketing promises.

**Unique Value Proposition (UVP):** For a low, one-time fee, Heatworks provides a tangible, data-driven diagnostic of a business's most critical marketing channel—local search. Unlike free, generic audits, it delivers a hyper-local heatmap visualization combined with a customized, actionable plan, instantly demonstrating value and building trust.

**Business Outcome:** Heatworks will serve as the primary lead generation tool for Gruntworks, converting prospects into paying customers for a low-cost offer. It will effectively qualify leads and create a data-backed, urgent need for Gruntworks' core, high-ticket services: SeedWorks (SEO), SiteWorks (Websites), and FlowWorks (Automation).

## Goals and Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to launch the Heatworks MVP as a scalable, self-funding lead generation engine for Gruntworks' core services.

*   **Goal 1: Validate Market Demand.**
    *   **Objective:** Achieve at least 5 sales from a small, targeted list of warm leads within 48 hours of launch.
*   **Goal 2: Prove Operational Viability.**
    *   **Objective:** Successfully deliver 100% of initial orders within the 24-hour SLA using the defined manual fulfillment process.
    *   **Objective:** Time the manual fulfillment process for at least 3 orders and ensure the average time is under 60 minutes per order.
*   **Goal 3: Gather Critical Feedback.**
    *   **Objective:** Conduct a follow-up call with at least 50% of the initial buyers to gather feedback on the deliverables, perceived value, and clarity of the upsell path.
*   **Goal 4: Generate Qualified Sales Opportunities.**
    *   **Objective:** Achieve a 15% or greater conversion rate from Heatworks purchase to a booked discovery call for a core service within the first 90 days of launch.
*   **Goal 5: Create a Compelling Case for Upselling.**
    *   **Objective:** Achieve a 20% or greater close rate on core service proposals presented to clients who have purchased the Heatworks audit.
*   **Goal 6: Validate Scalability.**
    *   **Objective:** Successfully process 50 Heatworks orders through the automated/semi-automated fulfillment system in the first 60 days post-launch to validate the workflow.

## Target Audience
**Primary Persona: The "Empowered Landscaper"** (Owner/Manager of a mid-sized home services business)

*   **Demographics:** Owner of an established regional business with $500k - $5M+ in annual revenue. Often has a physical office and multiple crews.
*   **Psychographics:**
    *   **Drivers:** Growth, profitability, operational efficiency, and building a professional legacy. They are proud of their craft and want their online presence to reflect that quality.
    *   **Anxieties:** Intense pressure from labor shortages, economic uncertainty, and competition. They are skeptical of marketing "gurus" due to past negative experiences and fear complex, expensive technology that doesn't deliver clear ROI.
*   **Needs:** They need a straightforward, no-nonsense way to see if their marketing is working. They value tangible proof and actionable advice over abstract strategies. They are time-poor and need solutions that are easy to understand and implement.
*   **Pain Points Addressed by Heatworks:**
    *   "I get calls, but I feel like I'm missing out on jobs in certain neighborhoods."
    *   "I paid an agency for SEO before but saw no real results."
    *   "I don't have time to figure out if my website and Google listing are set up correctly."
    *   "I need to know where to focus my efforts for the biggest impact."

## Competitive Landscape
*   **Competitor 1: Generalist Digital Marketing Agencies**
    *   **Strengths:** Often offer "free SEO audits" as a lead magnet.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Their audits are typically automated, generic, and lack hyper-local context. They use high-pressure sales tactics and don't understand the nuances of the home services industry.
    *   **Our Differentiator:** Heatworks is a paid product, which filters for serious clients. It provides a highly specific, visual diagnostic (the heatmap) that generic audits lack, combined with a customized plan rooted in deep industry knowledge (Gruntworks brand).

*   **Competitor 2: DIY SEO Software (e.g., SEMrush, Moz Local)**
    *   **Strengths:** Powerful tools that provide a wealth of data for those who know how to use them.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Overly complex, expensive on a subscription basis, and require significant time and expertise to interpret. They don't provide a "done-for-you" interpretation or actionable plan.
    *   **Our Differentiator:** Heatworks bridges the gap between raw data and actionable strategy. We do the analysis and provide a clear, concise improvement plan, saving the business owner time and cognitive load.

*   **Competitor 3: Niche Industry Consultants**
    *   **Strengths:** Deep industry knowledge and trust.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Often lack the technical tools and scalability to offer a data-driven product like the heatmap at a low cost. Their advice can be strategic but not always backed by hyper-local performance data.
    *   **Our Differentiator:** We combine the technical sophistication of an SEO tool with the trusted, niche expertise of a consultant, delivered in a scalable, affordable package.

## Scope
### In Scope
*   **Landing Page:** A single, functional landing page built with a rapid development tool (e.g., Carrd, Webflow).
*   **Payment:** A simple Stripe Payment Link (not a deep API integration).
*   **Whitelabel Partner:** Selection and account setup with a heatmap provider (e.g., LocalFalcon).
*   **Deliverable Templates:** Finalized templates for the 100-Point Audit and 30-Day Plan in Google Docs/Sheets.
*   **Manual Fulfillment SOP:** A documented, step-by-step checklist for the fulfillment specialist to follow for each order.
*   **Email Templates:** Simple text-based emails for order confirmation and deliverable delivery (to be sent manually).
*   **Soft Launch:** Outreach to a pre-defined list of 20-30 warm leads.

### Out of Scope
*   **Automation:** Any integration between Stripe, email, and the heatmap provider (e.g., via Zapier/n8n). This is a top priority post-validation.
*   **Custom Client Dashboard:** Clients will receive deliverables via email (PDFs and a link to the whitelabel report).
*   **Building a custom tool:** All tools are off-the-shelf.
*   **Broad Marketing Campaign:** No paid ads or large-scale email campaigns.
*   **Internal `HEATWORKS_PLAYBOOK.md`:** A formal playbook will be created after the validation sprint.

## Key Deliverables
### Product
1.  **Heatmap Dashboard:** A configured and tested whitelabeled heatmap report.
2.  **"Red Zone Revenue Leakage Report" Template:** A standardized Google Sheet model that allows a fulfillment specialist to input the number of low-ranking zones from a client's heatmap and automatically calculates an "Estimated Monthly Revenue Leakage" figure based on pre-set industry assumptions (avg. search volume, conversion rate, client job value). This is designed to translate map rankings into direct, tangible business costs.
3.  **"100-Point Competitive Edge Audit" Template:** A comprehensive audit checklist designed to establish overwhelming proof of the complexity of local SEO. Items will be pre-categorized into "Momentum Items" (simple fixes) and "Core Engine Items" (complex issues requiring expert help).
4.  **"30-Day Momentum Plan" Template:** A customizable Google Doc that pulls the "Momentum Items" from the audit and provides clear, easy-to-follow DIY instructions. It will explicitly state that "Core Engine Items" are out of scope for a DIY plan.

### Technical
5.  Functional Stripe integration for payment processing.
6.  Automated email sequence for onboarding and deliverable delivery.

### Marketing & Sales
7.  High-conversion landing page for the Heatworks offer.
8.  **Time-Sensitive Strategy Session & Credit Offer:** A defined process for a post-audit follow-up call. This includes a 72-hour time limit for booking the call to unlock a $250 credit towards a Gruntworks core service. This incentivizes rapid engagement and shortens the sales cycle.
9.  Sales collateral and scripts for the **"HEAT-to-CORE Conversion Call,"** focusing on using the Revenue Leakage Report and the "Core Engine" audit items to build an undeniable case for our high-ticket services.

### Internal Governance
10. **`HEATWORKS_PLAYBOOK.md`**: A comprehensive internal guide detailing the offer, SOPs, pricing, SLAs, and sales responses (modeled after the SeedWorks playbook).

    *   **Direct Competitor Threat-Based Outreach:** Use scraping tools to identify target businesses *and* a specific, high-ranking competitor in their key service areas. This intelligence will be used to craft hyper-personalized, provocative cold outreach campaigns. The core message is not "you have a problem," but "your competitor is actively taking money from you, and we have the proof."
    *   Create case studies and testimonials from initial customers.
    *   Begin automation planning based on bottlenecks identified in Week 2.
*   **Dependencies:** Week 2 completion and refined processes.

#### Week 4: Outreach Scale-Up & Technical Infrastructure
*   **Duration:** 1 week (Week 4 post-launch)
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Personalized Cold Email Campaign Launch:** Launch systematic cold email campaigns using the competitor threat intelligence gathered in Week 3.

    *   **Implement Automation:** Implement workflow automation (Zapier/n8n) to connect Stripe payments to fulfillment triggers and set up automated email sequences for order confirmation and delivery.
    *   **Develop Internal Reporting:** Build internal dashboards or reports to track order volume, fulfillment times, and conversion KPIs.
*   **Dependencies:** Week 3 completion and outreach lists ready.
*   **Milestone:** Multi-channel outreach campaigns launched; core automation workflows are live and tested.

## Technical Architecture
The Heatworks MVP will be architected as a "service chain" that leverages third-party APIs and internal processes, minimizing custom development.

**Conceptual Flow:**
1.  **Lead Generation:** A targeted **Email Campaign** directs a warm lead to the **Landing Page** (Carrd/Webflow).
2.  **Payment:** The user clicks a button and is taken to a hosted **Stripe Payment Link** to pay the $149 fee.
3.  **Notification:** Upon successful payment, Stripe sends a standard **Email Notification** to a designated internal email address (e.g., `orders@gruntworks.com`).
4.  **Manual Trigger:** The **Fulfillment Specialist** sees the email notification, which is the trigger to begin the process.
5.  **Manual Fulfillment:** The specialist follows the **Manual Fulfillment SOP (Google Doc Checklist)**:
    *   Logs into the **Whitelabel Heatmap Tool** to run the report.
    *   Fills out the **Report & Plan Templates (Google Docs)**.
    *   Saves the final reports as PDFs.
6.  **Manual Delivery:** The specialist sends the **Deliverable Email** manually from their email client, attaching the PDFs and the link to the live heatmap report.

**Future State (Post-Validation) Automated Flow:**
1.  **User Journey:** Prospect visits the **Heatworks Landing Page** (built on Webflow/WordPress) -> Clicks "Get My Audit" -> Redirected to **Stripe Checkout** for the $149 payment.
2.  **Payment & Onboarding:** Upon successful payment, a **Stripe Webhook** triggers an action in an automation platform (e.g., n8n, Zapier).
3.  **Trigger Fulfillment:** The automation platform sends an **Onboarding Email** to the customer with a unique link to connect their Google Business Profile (using the whitelabel partner's OAuth flow).
4.  **Data Pull:** Once the customer authorizes their GBP, a webhook from the **Whitelabel Partner** (e.g., LocalFalcon API) notifies our automation platform. The platform then triggers the heatmap generation via API call.
5.  **Report Generation:** The fulfillment team is notified. They access the generated heatmap, run the business through the **100-Point Audit Checklist (Google Sheet/Internal Tool)**, and use the findings to populate the **30-Day Plan Template**.
6.  **Delivery:** The final PDF reports (Audit + Plan) and the link to the live heatmap dashboard are sent to the customer via a final **Deliverable Email**.

## Risk Analysis
*   **Risk 1: Aggressive Tactics Backfire.**
    *   **Description:** The "Revenue Leakage Report" and "Competitor Threat" outreach are perceived as overly aggressive, fear-mongering, or unprofessional, damaging the Gruntworks brand reputation.
    *   **Probability:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium
    *   **MitigationStrategy:** The key is confident, data-backed framing. All communications must present the information as objective "business intelligence," not an attack. The models must use defensible (even conservative) assumptions. We are not creating fear; we are revealing the uncomfortable truth of the market. A/B test outreach copy to find the sweet spot between aggressive and effective.
*   **Risk 2: Financial Opportunity Analysis is Misinterpreted.**
    *   **Description:** The client misinterprets the illustrative financial analysis as a literal guarantee of lost revenue, leading to unmet expectations or feelings of being subjected to high-pressure tactics.
    *   **Probability:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** The report template must clearly and repeatedly label the analysis as an "illustrative estimate based on industry averages." The fulfillment specialist and any sales-focused team members must be trained to frame this analysis correctly as a tool for contextualizing opportunity, not as a statement of fact.
*   **Risk 3: Fulfillment Bottleneck.**
    *   **Description:** If the launch is more successful than expected (e.g., >10 orders on Day 1), the manual process will become a bottleneck, breaking the 24-hour SLA.
    *   **Probability:** Low (for this controlled launch)
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **MitigationStrategy:** Cap the offer. The landing page and email copy can state "Limited to the first 10 businesses." This creates urgency and protects the SLA. Have a backup person trained on the SOP.
*   **Risk 4: Unclear Value Proposition.**
    *   **Description:** The landing page and offer fail to convince even warm leads to purchase, resulting in zero or very few sales.
    *   **Probability:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **MitigationStrategy:** Leverage strong social proof and specific pain points in the copy. The offer must be crystal clear: "See your Google Maps blind spots for $149." Before launching, get feedback on the landing page from 1-2 trusted customers.
*   **Risk 5: Low User Activation Post-Payment.**
    *   **Description:** Users pay the $149 fee but fail to complete the subsequent step of connecting their Google Business Profile, stalling the fulfillment process.
    *   **Probability:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (Prevents delivery, causes support load, hurts reputation)
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Design a frictionless onboarding flow with clear instructions. Implement an automated email reminder sequence (e.g., at 24h, 48h, 72h) for users who haven't connected their GBP.
*   **Risk 6: Technical Integration Failure.**
    *   **Description:** The whitelabel partner's API is unreliable, slow, or their OAuth connection for GBP is buggy, preventing us from meeting our 24-hour SLA.
    *   **Probability:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Thoroughly vet partners during the selection phase. Build manual overrides into the fulfillment process. Have a backup partner researched. Communicate transparently with clients if delays occur.
*   **Risk 7: Low Upsell Conversion Rate.**
    *   **Description:** The Heatworks audit successfully acquires customers, but fails to generate a sufficient number of qualified discovery calls or closed deals for core services, making the model unprofitable.
    *   **Probability:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** The entire funnel is now designed for this. The Revenue Leakage Report creates urgency. The audit's "Core Engine" items create a clear need. The **Time-Sensitive Strategy Session & Credit Offer** creates a powerful incentive to engage immediately. The script for the HEAT-to-CORE call must be laser-focused on connecting these three elements into an irresistible argument for our core services.

## Assumptions
*   **Market Assumption:** The $149 price point is low enough to be an impulse purchase for our target audience but high enough to filter out non-serious prospects.
*   **Technical Assumption:** A reliable whitelabel heatmap provider exists that offers a robust API, a clean whitelabeling experience, and a secure GBP connection flow.
*   **Value Assumption:** The combination of the heatmap, audit report, and action plan provides enough standalone value to create a positive customer experience and generate trust, even if the customer does not immediately upsell.
*   **Process Assumption:** The fulfillment process can be executed within 30-45 minutes per client by a trained specialist, allowing for scalability.

## Communication Plan
*   **Daily Kick-off (9 AM):** 15-minute sync for the sprint team to align on the day's goals and tasks.
*   **End-of-Day Check-in (4 PM):** 15-minute sync to report progress, demo work, and identify any blockers for the next day.
*   **Weekly Project Sync (Fridays):** 30-minute meeting with all stakeholders to review week's progress, demo completed work, and plan for the next week.
*   **Monthly KPI Review (Post-Launch):** 45-minute meeting with stakeholders to review performance against success metrics and plan optimizations.
*   **"War Room" Channel:** A dedicated Slack/Teams channel for constant, real-time communication throughout the sprint. All decisions and updates are posted here.

## Go-to-Market Strategy
The Go-to-Market strategy is to position Heatworks as the definitive "first step" for any serious home services business looking to grow through local search.

### Messaging Pillars
1.  **Stop Guessing. See the Financial Bleed:** "You can't fix what you can't see. We'll show you exactly where you're invisible on Google and estimate the revenue you're losing every month."
2.  **Your Competitor Is Eating Your Lunch. Here's How to Fight Back:** "Generic reports don't work. We deliver competitive intelligence that pinpoints where your rivals are winning and provides a clear plan to reclaim your territory."
3.  **From Data to Dollars:** "Don't just get a report, get a roadmap. We'll show you the issues *and* the potential financial opportunity you're missing."
4.  **Momentum Now, Dominance Later:** "Get a 30-day 'quick-win' playbook for immediate results, and a clear, expert-led roadmap for long-term market leadership."

        *   Analyze data from initial sprint orders (fulfillment times, customer feedback, conversion rates).
        *   Conduct follow-up calls with initial customers to gather detailed feedback.
        *   Refine templates and SOP based on real-world learnings.
        *   Document lessons learned from manual fulfillment process.
        *   Expand warm lead outreach to additional segments.
    *   **Week 3 - Content & Marketing Expansion:**
        *   **Content Marketing:** Publish 2-3 blog posts on the Gruntworks site about "The Hidden Costs of Google Maps Invisibility" and "How to Audit Your Local SEO," with strong CTAs to the Heatworks offer.
        *   **Direct Competitor Threat-Based Outreach:** Use scraping tools to identify target businesses *and* a specific, high-ranking competitor in their key service areas. This intelligence will be used to craft hyper-personalized, provocative cold outreach campaigns. The core message is not "you have a problem," but "your competitor is actively taking money from you, and we have the proof."
        *   Create case studies and testimonials from initial customers.
        *   Begin automation planning based on bottlenecks identified in Week 2.
    *   **Week 4 - Outreach Scale-Up & Technical Infrastructure:**
        *   **Personalized Cold Email Campaign Launch:** Launch systematic cold email campaigns using the competitor threat intelligence gathered in Week 3. Messaging should be highly tailored and provocative. Start at 250 emails/week with goal to ramp up to 5000/month over 120 days.
        *   **LinkedIn Cold DM Campaign:** Launch targeted LinkedIn DM campaigns to identified landscaping/home services business owners and managers (where LinkedIn profiles are available).
        *   **X.com Cold DM Campaign:** Launch Twitter/X DM campaigns to identified industry professionals and business owners (where X.com profiles are available).
        *   **Cold Calling Integration:** Integrate cold calling follow-ups for email and social media prospects using enriched contact data.
        *   **Remove "Pilot Program" Messaging:** Update the landing page and all marketing collateral to remove any mention of "pilot" or "limited launch," positioning Heatworks as a core, established service.
        *   **Implement Automation:** Implement workflow automation (Zapier/n8n) to connect Stripe payments to fulfillment triggers and set up automated email sequences for order confirmation and delivery.
        *   **Develop Internal Reporting:** Build internal dashboards or reports to track order volume, fulfillment times, and conversion KPIs.
    *   **Dependencies:** Week 3 completion and outreach lists ready.
    *   **Milestone:** Multi-channel outreach campaigns launched; core automation workflows are live and tested.

*   **Phase 3 - Scale & Integration (Post-Week 4):**
    *   **Post-Audit Conversion Strategy:** The primary goal after delivering the Heatworks report is to convert the customer to a core service.
        *   **The Time-Sensitive Strategy Session:** The "Deliverable Ready" email contains the strong, time-bound call-to-action for the client to book their 30-minute Strategy Session to unlock their $250 service credit.
        *   **Consultative, Urgent Framing:** This call is not a hard sales pitch. It's a consultative session that uses the client's own data (especially the Revenue Leakage Report) to establish the high cost of inaction, creating natural urgency.
        *   **Natural Upsell Path:** The debrief will naturally transition from discussing the "Foundational Roadmap" items to explaining how SeedWorks, SiteWorks, or FlowWorks are the logical next steps to solve those specific problems. The service credit serves to close the deal.
    *   Use testimonials and case studies from the initial launches in all marketing materials.
    *   Create short video ads showing a blurred heatmap turning clear, visualizing the core benefit.
    *   Integrate the Heatworks offer as the primary CTA across the entire Gruntworks website and at the bottom of all marketing emails.
    *   Train additional team members on the refined fulfillment process.
    *   Implement monitoring and alerting systems for order volume.
    *   Launch to wider audience and begin ongoing optimization.
